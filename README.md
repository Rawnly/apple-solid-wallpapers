# Solid Wallpapers
> Some solid 4k/8k landscape/portrait solid background wallpapers for your device.

## What?
Wallpapers are divided in 2 categories, *filled* (white logo on coloured background) and "*on white*" (coloured logo on white background)

## Why
I love solid backgrounds, they looks minimal, but the default Apple's wallpapers are too poor to be a wallpaper, so I've tried to create my own wallpapers following the [Apple human interface guidelines (iOS)][human-interface-guidelines] palette and adding the Apple logo in the centre.
